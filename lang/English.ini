shuffle_fields_dataentry_desc = "See <code>@SHUFFLE-FIELDS-SURVEY</code> for a complete description. When used on a survey, it may be useful to see the questions on a data entry form in the same order as they were displayed to the survey participant. In this case, make sure that both action tags are applied to the same field (holding the order) with the exact same parameters."
shuffle_fields_survey_desc = "This will randomize the question order on survey pages (or data entry forms, see <code>@SHUFFLE-FIELDS-DATAENTRY</code>) as per the instructions provided. The order, in which fields were displayed is captured in a field of type <i>Text Box</i>, to which this action tag should be applied to. Please note that all fields that are shuffled as well as the field that holds the displayed order <b>must</b> be on the same survey page.<br>The action tag takes a comma-separated list (in quotes) of the variable names of the fields whose order should be randomized. For example, to randomize the order of the fields <i>q1</i>, <i>q2</i>, <i>q3</i>, and <i>q4</i>, add<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<code>@SHUFFLE-FIELDS-SURVEY=\"q1,q3,q3,q4\"</code><br>to a <i>Text Box</i> field, e.g., named <code>[q1_4_order]</code>.<br>It is advisable to add the <code>@HIDDEN-SURVEY</code> and <code>@READONLY</code> action tags to this field as well.<br>This module supports <b>shuffling of blocks</b> of questions. In order to achieve this, the fields inside a block must be grouped inside parenthesis in the action tag parameters. For example, let's assume there are seven questions, <i>q1</i> to <i>q7</i>, but the questions 1-3 and 6-7 should always stay together and in a defined order. To randomize these four blocks, add<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<code>@SHUFFLE-FIELDS-SURVEY=\"(q1,q2,q3),q4,q5,(q6,q7)\"</code><br>to the text field that will capture the displayed order. Shuffle results might then be: <i>b5-b1+b2+b3-b6+b7-b4</i> or <i>b6+q7-b1+b2+b3-b5-b4</i> (+ is used as in-block delimiter instead of the hyphen).<br>When a survey page (or data entry form) is rendered that already has (valid) data in the field holding the field order, then this order will be replicated. If the stored data is invalid, then no field reordering will occur."
